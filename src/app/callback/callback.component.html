                <h4 class="card-text">In computer programming, a callback, also known as a "call-after"[1] function, is any executable code that 
                    is passed as an argument to other code; that other code is expected to call back (execute) the argument at a given time. This 
                    execution may be immediate as in a synchronous callback, or it might happen at a later time as in an asynchronous callback. 
                    Programming languages support callbacks in different ways, often implementing them with subroutines, lambda expressions, blocks, 
                    or function pointers..</h4>
